# CellTracksColab Viewer: Alpha Testing

Thank you for participating in the alpha testing of the **CellTracksColab Viewer** plugin! Please follow the steps below to install and test the plugin in Napari.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the plugin, make sure you have the following set up:

1. **Python 3.7 or later**: You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Napari**: If you donâ€™t already have Napari installed, you can install it via `pip` or use Conda to manage your environment.

   To install Napari with `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install "napari[all]"
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install it using Conda (recommended for managing Python environments):

   ```bash
   conda create -n napari-env python=3.9
   conda activate napari-env
   pip install napari
   ```

## Step 1: Clone the Plugin Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the plugin repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/celltrackscolab-viewer.git
   cd celltrackscolab-viewer
   ```

This will create a local copy of the plugin repository on your computer.

## Step 2: Install the Plugin Locally

1. After cloning the repository, navigate to the plugin folder (if not already there).
2. Install the plugin in editable mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   The `-e` flag installs the plugin in "editable" mode, allowing you to make changes and test them immediately without needing to reinstall the plugin.

## Step 3: Run Napari and Test the Plugin

1. Once the plugin is installed, you can start Napari by typing:

   ```bash
   napari
   ```

2. In Napari, go to the **Plugins** menu and look for **CellTracksColab Viewer**. From here, you can:
   - **Load CSV data**: Use the plugin to load track data from CSV files. Here you should open the **merged_Spots.csv** file
   - **Load TIFF images (optional)**: You can load corresponding microscopy TIFF images and overlay them with track data.
   - **Visualize Tracks**: Select filenames and visualize the tracks in the Napari viewer.

3. test data is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11286110)


## Step 4: Reporting Bugs and Providing Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please report them by creating an issue in the GitHub repository:

1. Go to the [Issues section](https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/celltrackscolab-viewer/issues) of the repository.
2. Create a new issue, providing as much detail as possible, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Screenshots or error messages (if applicable).
   - Napari version and operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Thank you for your time and feedback!
